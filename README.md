# json-schema-editor
Dynamically generated, form-based editor focussed on developing/editing JSON Schema documents based on the JSON Meta-Schema using the JSON-Editor [1] control. 

The developments will include both the production of a new JSON-Editor example, and potentially the streamlining of the JSON Meta-Schema to focus on its usage within this new form.
